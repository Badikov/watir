<p>There are four built in methods that you can use to make your waiting experience more pleasant (and remove those evil sleep statements from your code) Watir::Wait.until { … }: where you can wait for a block to be true object.when_present.set: where you can do something when it’s present object.wait_until_present:; where you just wait until something is present object.wait_while_present:; where you just wait until something disappears The default timeout for all these methods is 30 seconds, but your can pass an argument to any of these to increase (or decrease) it as needed.</p>
