<p>In the more informal discussion/interview format, I can talk on "anything" related to watir-webdriver or WebDriver, or just general Ruby stuff :) I could probably also talk a bit about the future for WebDriver - especially the work we're currently doing with the W3C to create a browser automation standard.</p>
