    \r\n\r\nMy name is Jason Daugherty and I'm a recruiter for Facebook's core engineering
    group. I was originally referred to the Watir Day Conference by Allister Scott.
    \r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the conference page, we (Facebook) would like to register
    as an official sponsor. May I ask, what does a sponsorship entail? Is this possible?
    Myself and two (possibly three) engineers would like to attend the conference.
    \r\n\r\nAlso, the engineers asked for me to inquire about possibly speaking at
    the conference... Is there an open time slot to add a guest speaker? Or is the
    speaker list already set? \r\n\r\nPlease feel free to let me know what additional
    information you need from us on our end, as well as how we can go about payment
    for the sponsorship. \r\n\r\nRegards, \r\nJason \r\n\r\nJason Daugherty | facebook
