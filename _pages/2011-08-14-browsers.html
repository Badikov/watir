<p>Watir-WebDriver supports the browsers that WebDriver supports.</p>
<h1>Firefox</h1>
<p>Firefox is supported through a JavaScript driver, therefore 'it just worksâ„¢' on all platforms.</p>
<pre>b = Watir::Browser.new :firefox</pre>
<h1>Chrome</h1>
<p>Chrome support is through the platform specific ChromeDriver binary, which you <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/downloads/list">download</a> and put on your path.</p>
<pre>b = Watir::Browser.new :chrome</pre>
<h1>Internet Explorer</h1>
<p>Internet Explorer should just work, as long as the protected mode setting is the same for every internet zone (all on, or all off).</p>
<pre>b = Watir::Browser.new :ie</pre>
