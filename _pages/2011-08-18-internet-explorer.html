<h2>IE on Windows</h2>
<p>Internet Explorer is Windows only (duh!) and only works if you ensure that protected mode is either all on, or all off, for all zones.</p>
<p>[sourcecode language="ruby" light="true"]<br />
b = Watir::Browser.new :ie<br />
[/sourcecode]</p>
<h2>Internet Explorer Config</h2>
<p>Watir-WebDriver uses your standard IE settings and config, so you should manually adjust IE to how you want it before running your tests, which will pick up these settings.</p>
