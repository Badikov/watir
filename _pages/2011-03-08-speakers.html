<em>Watir 3 and the Future</em><br />
Opera Software ASA</p>
<p>Watir makes automated testing of web applications easy and accessible for  everyone.  Yet between different versions and implementations of Watir  there is a gap in test- and infrastructural compliancy.  This talk will  present a proposal for a new, universal API called Watir 3.   Imagine if you could take your tests and run them on one single  consolidated implementation, using any major browser.  At Opera, we soon  ran into problems using the traditional APIs when trying to utilize  Watir in our internal testing.  One possible solution is to create a  universal API generic enough for the older APIs to easily plug in to it,  and specific enough to not introduce any further complexity for normal  users.   The talk will give you a brief introduction to the use cases of  employing Watir to test web browsers, a demo of what the next generation  Watir might look like, and my own thoughts on designing good APIs for  tomorrow, where technologies such as HTML 5 are just around the corner.</p>
<p><strong>Bio: </strong>Andreas is a QA Engineer at Opera Software, where he has  written an implementation of Watir for Opera.  He has a background as a  web developer and browser tester.  He holds a BA in Musicology from the  University of Oslo. He has held internal talks for Free Software Foundation Europe (on web  strategy), at Opera Software (for Core QA), and in political parties (on  ideology and political theory). Andreas will also be speaking at  the <a href="http://www.seleniumconf.com/">Selenium Conference</a> on OperaWatir and Testing at Opera.</p>

<em>Testing with Vision</em><br />
Convio</p>
<p>When Hugh started at Convio, there was no test automation and a small QA  team. Five years later, Convio running 40,000 automated tests with a much  larger, technical team. Hugh will talk about how the team and test  environment evolved and the role that Watir played. He'll also share what Convio are doing today, the tools they use, customizations they've  made to Watir and things they've done in the test framework to grow a  scalable test infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Bio:</strong> Hugh has been using Watir at Convio for the last five years and have been  actively involved in the local Watir community. He has also contributed to  several open source projects, in addition to creating Rasta and being a  lead developer for Roo.   Hugh has been in the QA industry for 18 years, mostly in a test automation  role. His previous work experience has included a relatively small number  of companies: Lacerte Software (now Intuit), Electronics for Imaging,  and Akamai. He's currently a Principal QA Engineer at Convio.</p>

<em>WebDriver</em><br />
Google</p>
<p>A move towards a standard API offered by browsers to facilitate testing makes a lot of sense for those of us on the sharp-end of testing, but until recently it hasn't been clear what that API should be. With both Opera and Google already offering support for the WebDriver APIs and the next versions of both Watir and Selenium being based on it, now's the time for that standard to emerge. This talk will describe our plans for reaching a standard, who's already involved and a tour of the proposed standard as it stands today.</p>
<p><strong>Bio:</strong> Simon lives in London and works as a Software Engineer in Test at  Google. His Open Source contributions center on Selenium, where he’s  one of the noisier members of the community and a core contributor to  the project. It has been said before that Simon enjoys beer and writing  better software, sometimes at the same time. This is true. He is also  the top hit for the search term “steel cage knife fight”, a fact that  makes in inordinately proud.</p>
