<p>We are currently interested in hearing from people who'd like to present at the Test Automation Bazaar: a two day conference in Austin, Texas from March 23rd and 24th.</p>
<p>The focus of the conference will be on test automation in Ruby (not necessarily Watir), and <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SpecificationByExample.html">specification by example</a>: tying automated tests to business context.</p>
<p><strong></strong>We are looking for short, relevant presentations that can run in a facilitated/interview format. You don't need presentation experience: we are planning to conduct some mentoring/coaching for presenters - so stay tuned. If you're interested, please register your interest here as soon as possible - you don't need to spend a long time writing a lengthy proposal.</p>
