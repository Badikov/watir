<p>If you would like to talk to me about Watir, let me know. All you need is about minutes, Skype and a microphone. There is a list of <a href="/questions/">questions</a> I usually ask, but do not get over prepared. :)</p>
<p>After the podcast is recorded and edited, I will upload it to the site, but I will not publish it. I will send you the link to the file and only after you say it is ok, I will publish it. I can always cut anything you would not like to be published, or delete the podcast and never publish it if that is what you want.</p>
<p>I will need your small image of you for the episode page (73×73 px), but that is optional. The name of the company you work for and your job title there are optional too.</p>
<p>If you have a band (or know somebody that has a band) and you would like a little promotion, let me know. I can use about 30 seconds of music at the beginning and about 60 seconds at the end of each show.</p>
<p>If you have a question or six, if you would like to suggest somebody I should talk to, leave a comment.</p>
