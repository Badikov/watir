<p>The planning for the Watir Day 2011 in San Francisco on Sunday April 3rd is progressing well.</p>
<h2>Propose a Talk</h2>
<p>You can propose a 30 minute talk from now until Sunday 27th February 2011 using the <a href="http://watir.com/watir-day/propose-a-talk/">online form</a>. Speakers will be notified and announced within a week of the closing date.</p>
<h2>Be a Sponsor</h2>
<p>Your company can now <a href="http://watir.com/watir-day/sponsorship/">register to be a sponsor of Watir Day 2011</a> which costs only <strong>$175</strong>, and includes four tickets valued at $200. How cool is that!</p>
<h2>Buy a Ticket (soon)</h2>
<p>Tickets for Watir Day 2011 will be $50 each, and will be available in the next week or so on Eventbrite. But in the meantime, convince your boss to be a <a href="http://watir.com/watir-day/sponsorship/">sponsor</a>, it's cheaper per ticket!</p>
<h2>Stay Tuned</h2>
<p>This blog will be updated as soon as we have more information available about Watir Day 2011. Hope to see you there!</p>
<h2>Update (2/22/2011)</h2>
<p>Registrations are now <a href="http://watirday.eventbrite.com/">live </a>on Eventbrite</p>
