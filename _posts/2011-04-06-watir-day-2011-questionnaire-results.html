<p><a href="http://watir.com/watir-day/">Watir Day 2011</a> went well on Sunday in San Francisco. We had about 60 attendees from various places, and 10 sponsors.</p>
<p>Most of the presentations are available online on <a href="http://wiki.openqa.org/display/WTR/Watir+Day+Presentations">the Watir Day Wiki</a>.</p>
<p>I sent out a questionnaire after the event, and there was an overwhelming positive response. My favourite questions are about what topics people found most interesting, how much fun they had, and whether they'd come again, and as you can see, it was a great day.</p>
