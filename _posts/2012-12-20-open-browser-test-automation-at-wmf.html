Almost a year ago I started working as <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User:Cmcmahon" target="_blank">QA Lead</a> for the <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Home" target="_blank">Wikimedia Foundation</a>.&nbsp; Among other things, I had a mandate to create an automated browser testing practice at WMF.</p>
<p>From the start I wanted this project to be a world class, completely open, reference implementation of such a project, using the best and most modern tools and practices I could find.&nbsp; I wanted this to be a project that anyone could read, anyone could run, and to which anyone could contribute.&nbsp; I wanted this to be an industry standard implementation of a well-designed, well-implemented, working browser test automation project.</p>
<p>Around 2006 my career had veered off into a test automation approach that, while valid and useful in certain circumstances, would be inappropriate for the WMF project.&nbsp; And in the years since 2006, the tools and practices that were immature at the time had grown into mature, stable, powerful projects of their own.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I set out to educate myself about the details of the cutting edge of browser test automation in every language.&nbsp; I visited Austin TX twice and San Francisco several times in the past year to discuss approaches to the project in person with experts on the subject.&nbsp; </p>
<p>WMF hired <a href="https://twitter.com/zeljkofilipin/" target="_blank">Željko Filipin</a> in October 2012 specifically for the browser test automation project, and just this week we opened the curtain and turned on the lights.&nbsp; The WMF browser test automation project is in Ruby, using</p>
<p>* page_object gem<br />
* watir-webdriver<br />
* selenium-webdriver<br />
* Cucumber<br />
* RSpec<br />
* rake<br />
* Jenkins integration</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/wiki/wikitech/319419" target="_blank">initial announcement is here</a>. <br />
A <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/QA/running_and_writing_browser_tests" target="_blank">first pass at technical documentation is here</a>, including instructions to run the tests locally if you want to see them in action on your own machine. <br />
Some <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Browser_testing/community_automated_browser_testing" target="_blank">community concerns are here</a>. <br />
The main code base is <a href="https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/q/status:merged+project:qa/browsertests,n,z" target="_blank">managed in gerrit</a> but there is a more accessible <a href="https://github.com/wikimedia/qa-browsertests" target="_blank">read-only mirror on github</a>. <br />
Our Jenkins instance is running on the <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/" target="_blank">Cloudbees</a> service&nbsp; using <a href="https://saucelabs.com/" target="_blank">Sauce Labs</a>&nbsp; hosts, and the current <a href="https://wmf.ci.cloudbees.com/" target="_blank">test results are visible here</a>. <br />
If you would like to follow the project or contribute to it yourself, we are starting a community group you can join.&nbsp; Feel free to <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Groups/Proposals/Browser_testing" target="_blank">add yourself to the page here</a>&nbsp; to follow the project or contribute to it. </p>
<p>Many people helped me along the way to making this project what it is.&nbsp; Hopefully I haven't left out anyone, feel free to remind me if I did! </p>
