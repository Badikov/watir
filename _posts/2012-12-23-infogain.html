<p>Anukul Singhal from Infogain has recently requested to add the company he is working for to our Watir Users list.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi,</p>
<p>I work at Infogain and would like to include our company’s logo on the Watir page.</p>
<p>We have been using Watir extensively for the past 4 years and built a data driven framework on it. Also, for cross browser support (firefox, chrome), we have incorporated watir-webdriver gem, and also using this in conjunction with the cucumber framework.</p>
<p>This has been working wonders for us, and we run a suite of about 350 testcases on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you can include our company’s logo, and any specific information that you might require.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Anukul Singhal</p></blockquote>
<p>If you would like to add your company to the list send us a logo (150×51), link to the home page and (if possible) a link to the page that says you are using Watir. The Watir Users list is at the bottom of our <a href="http://watir.com/">home page</a> (above comments).</p>
