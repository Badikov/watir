<p>This is the first time I have published a podcast that I did not record, but this is one of the best talks I have heard so far and I thought it should be published here.</p>
<p>I would like to thank <a href="http://mkl-testhead.blogspot.com/">Michael</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/mkltesthead">Larsen</a> for producing the podcast. Show notes are at <a href="http://mkl-testhead.blogspot.com/p/podcasts.html">Michael Larsen's Podcasts page</a> and Bret's blog post <a href="http://watir.com/2011/05/15/a-ninja-strike-to-the-brain/">A Ninja Strike to the Brain</a>. Bret's blog post also has video version of the talk.</p>
