<p>A couple of people got added to the <a href="http://watir.com/team/">team</a> recently, Justin Ko and Dave McNulla.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1447" align="alignnone" width="150"]<img src="assets/justin_200.png?w=150" alt="Justin Ko" width="150" height="150" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1447" /> Justin Ko[/caption]</p>
<p>I have noticed that Justin has <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/badges/1104/watir">Watir badge</a> at Stackoverflow. As far as I am concerned, that makes him a Watir support sheriff. I have contacted him and he said: "Sure, it would be an honour to be part of the Watir team."</p>
<p>In his own words:</p>
<blockquote><p>Justin Ko has been a software tester for 5 years, specializing in exploratory testing and test automation with Watir. He joined StackOverflow and started a blog (<a href="http://jkotests.wordpress.com/">jkotests.wordpress.com</a>) to share his experiences. He looks forward to continuing to provide StackOverflow support as part of the Watir team.</p></blockquote>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1451" align="alignnone" width="128"]<img src="assets/dave_128.jpeg" alt="Dave McNulla" width="128" height="128" class="size-full wp-image-1451" /> Dave McNulla[/caption]</p>
<p>Dave has recorded 6 <a href="http://watirpodcast.zeljkofilipin.com/">Watir podcast</a> episodes (and counting). He is also active at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/396986/dave-mcnulla">Stack Overflow</a> and <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/watir-general">watir-general</a>.</p>
<p>He has a <a href="http://dmcnulla.wordpress.com/">blog</a> and he is tweets as <a href="https://twitter.com/dmcnulla">@dmcnulla</a>.</p>
<p>In his own words:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am Dave McNulla and I've been testing software since 1993. I started experimenting with Microsoft Test in 1995 for pre-web applications. I used that and other vendor tools for years. In 2008, I tried Watir for the first time to build a test framework that was used for years. </p>
<p>I started listening to the Watir podcast soon after and loved the good ideas from it. When I met the host, Å½eljko Filipin, I wanted to help keep the podcast going.</p>
<p>If you have interesting experiences or know of a good blog about using Watir, please send me an email.</p></blockquote>
<p>Justin, Dave, welcome to the team! :)</p>
